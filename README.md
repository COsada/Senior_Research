# Senior Research
  The goal of this project is to compare and contrast
how various sorting algorithms handle 'unusual datasets'.
Unusual datasets are datasets who's order of elements are not completely randomized. Examples include already sorted lists, lists that were sorted backwards, etc. At the end of this project the best performing sorting algorithm for each set of trials will be noted, as will the best 'all around' performer.
